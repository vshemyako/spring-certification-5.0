 * Question 032:<br>
 * How many profiles can you have?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * Maximum number of profiles isn't mentioned in java-docs or Spring reference documentation, therefore we can assume
 * that number of profiles is only limited by maximum size of an array in Java language which is 2^31 - 1 ({@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}).
