 * Question 003:<br>
 * What does CRUD mean?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * REST architecture is most commonly associated with http protocol and method which this protocol defines. CRUD is a
 * well-known acronym in computer programming which stands for <b>create, read, update, delete</b> operations performed
 * against records in a database. Http methods for manipulating resources are relatively similar to those used for
 * database records management. Mappings between those operations are roughly the following:<br>
 * - Create - POST<br>
 * - Read - GET<br>
 * - Update - PUT<br>
 * - Delete - DELETE<br>
