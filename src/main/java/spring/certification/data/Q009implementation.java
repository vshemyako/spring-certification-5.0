 * Question 009:<br>
 * Is a transaction a cross cutting concern?<br>
 * How is it implemented by Spring?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * Transaction management is one of the most frequently mentioned examples of a cross-cutting concern. It is implemented
 * in Spring Framework using aspect-oriented programming model (by creating a dynamic proxy which wraps target object).
 * Dynamic proxy type depends on the type of the target object: JDK dynamic proxy or CGLIB proxy might be created.<br>
