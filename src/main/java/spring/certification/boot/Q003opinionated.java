 * Question 003:<br>
 * Why is Spring Boot “opinionated”?<br>
 * <p>
 * Answer:<br>
 * Spring Boot framework is often called as being <i>opinionated</i> framework because Spring framework development team
 * has its own <i>opinion</i> of what default jars should make up spring-boot-starters and what beans should be autoconfigured
 * in case jars are detected on the classpath. More explicit term which is usually used within community is <i>convention
 * over configuration</i> - minimize decisions which are required from a developer.<br>
