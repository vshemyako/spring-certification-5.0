#### As of 2019.02.01 I've successfully passed the exam with 94% score. As a general suggestion Ivan Krizsan's book and Spring Reference Documentation are the most valuable sources.
#### Also, if you'd use this repository as a study guide - also look at [Spring Boot Web Application](https://github.com/vshemyako/spring-boot-web-application) and [Spring Web Application](https://github.com/vshemyako/web-application) repositories which cover some basic configuration and tests of Spring MVC and Spring Boot modules.
